# 🛡️ AutoGuard CI/CD
### A Self-Auditing DevSecOps Pipeline That Protects Your Deployments Before They Happen

---

## 🚨 The Use Case  

Every year, thousands of developers accidentally leak **API keys, passwords, or tokens** in public repositories or during production releases.  
Traditional CI/CD pipelines catch build errors — but not **security mistakes**.

That’s where **AutoGuard CI/CD** comes in.  

AutoGuard is an **AWS-powered, self-auditing pipeline** that scans your code for secrets and vulnerabilities *before* deploying.  
It acts as a **security gate** in your continuous delivery flow, automatically blocking risky commits and deploying only verified, safe builds.  

> 💬 *Think of it as a “firewall” for your CI/CD process.*

## 🧠 What This Project Does  

You can fork this repository and instantly get a ready-to-deploy **secure pipeline template** for your own web application.

### Key Features:
- **AWS CodePipeline** to automate build → test → deploy  
- **AWS CodeBuild** to compile your app and run the `autoguard.py` security scan  
- **AWS CodeDeploy** to ship artifacts to EC2  
- **AutoGuard Scanner** (custom Python script) that detects exposed keys, passwords, and secrets  
- **Maven build** for Java applications  
- **Terraform templates** for easy setup in your own AWS account

🧩 **Files Overview:**
- `autoguard.py` → runs in CodeBuild, scans code for secrets  
- `buildspec.yml` → defines CodeBuild phases and build commands  
- `appspec.yml` → manages deployment lifecycle on EC2  
- `terraform/` → deploys the entire stack in your AWS account

## 🚀 How to Use (Fork & Deploy Your Own AutoGuard CI/CD)

### 🧩 Step 1 — Fork This Repository  
Click **“Fork”** in the top-right corner to create your own copy.  
Clone it locally:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/autoguard-ci-cd.git
cd autoguard-ci-cd
🏗️ Step 2 — Deploy Infrastructure (AWS)
Use the included Terraform templates to provision your pipeline automatically.
```
Copy code
cd infra/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
This will set up:

CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy

S3 bucket for artifacts

IAM roles and policies

EC2 instance for deployment

🔒 Step 3 — AutoGuard Security Scan
Every time you push a commit, AutoGuard runs automatically in CodeBuild.
It scans your repository for sensitive patterns such as:

regex
Copy code
AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}          # AWS access keys  
password\s*=\s*["'].*["'] # Hardcoded passwords  
token\s*=\s*["'].*["']    # API tokens  
If any match is found, the build fails immediately — preventing deployment.

✅ Safe Commit Output
css
Copy code
🔒 Running AutoGuard security scan...
✅ No secrets found. Safe to deploy.
❌ Unsafe Commit Output
bash
Copy code
🚨 AutoGuard detected potential secrets:
src/main/resources/config.properties → password\s*=\s*[\'"].+[\'"]
❌ AutoGuard scan failed. Exiting build.
🧪 Step 4 — Build & Deploy Automatically
Once the scan passes:

CodeBuild runs your Maven build (mvn clean install)

CodeDeploy ships the .war file to your EC2 instance

CloudWatch logs every stage for full traceability

Your application is deployed securely and automatically 🚀

📊 Example Impact
Metric	Result
